# What to do for data in Allas after project ends?

Allas Object Storage is meant to host data for a project lifetime. After the project ends, you have several options where to move your data:

* You can move the data to a new project inside CSC

* You can archive the data in to a long-term data storage. Below are some services you might want to consider:
    * [IDA](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/){:target="_blank}
    * [CSC data management and storage services](https://research.csc.fi/data-management){:target="_blank"}
    * [PAS](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/fairdata-pas/){:target="_blank"}

* You can download the data to yourself (make sure you have enough space for the data)

* Delete the data (in case you are sure you do not need it anymore)
