# Can I have a personal project or bucket in Allas?

All the content of a project is available to all project members and all the project members have full access rights to all the buckets and the objects inside them.
Hence, you can <u>not</u> have personal bucket in a project including also other members.

Therefore, the only way to get personal project or buckets is being the only member in the project.
