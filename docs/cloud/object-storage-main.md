## Object Storage

Object storage is platform to store files so that they can be accessed from anywhere, inside and outside
the CSC environment over HTTPS. Files on object storage cannot be changed, so one needs to download, change, upload
instead. For those familiar with commercial cloud services, the
Amazon S3 is an example of an object storage service. The CSC object storage service is called Allas.

Files on object storage cannot be changed, so one needs to download, change, upload
instead. Object storage keeps files in buckets, and each bucket has a flat hierarchy,
i.e. no subfolders.
