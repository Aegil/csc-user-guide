## Using Pouta

The cPoutaÂ and ePouta services allow users of CSC to run one or more
virtual machines. Any CSC user with a computing project can request
access to the service  as  described  in [Getting access].
This  chapter  contains  information  about
launching virtual  machines in  the Pouta  service. The  first chapter
lists the available  virtual machine flavors (sizes),  while the other
chapters introduce the tools to  launch and manage virtual machines in
Pouta.</span>
