# Desmond

Desmond is a fast classical molecular dynamics simulation package
developed by the D.E.Shaw institute. It has a command line interface,
but it can also be used via the Schrödinger Maestro graphical user
interface.

## License

Desmond can be used for non-commercial research. A free Academic version
is available. Using it on CSC servers, requires agreeing to the [license agreement].
The free academic Maestro GUI is a stripped down version of the full commercial package.

Desmond is also available via the Schrödinger Maestro suite, which is
available only for the [Maestro Consortium][Maestro], which requires a separate license.

## Available

* Will be available on Puhti, version XXX

## Usage

The simulations are set up by a free for academic users version of the
Schrödinger Maestro GUI. The GUI can be run on taito-shell or installed
and run locally. Simulations are best run as batch jobs on Puhti-AI (GPGPU)
platform.

To start using Desmond on Puhti give:

    module load desmond
    desmond

Detailed instructions to preparing jobs locally and running them on
Puhti-AI can be found on our [Maestro page] (which
is for the commercial version of Maestro, which is available only for
the consortium members, but the steps are identical)
