# CASTEP

CASTEP is a plane wave based condensed phase Density Functional Theory
(DFT) module of [Materials Studio]. It can be used to simulate the
properties of solids, interfaces, and surfaces for a wide range of
materials classes including ceramics, semiconductors, and metals.

First principle calculations allow researchers to investigate the nature
and origin of the electronic, optical, and structural properties of a
system with high accuracy without the need for any experimental input
other than the atomic number of mass of the constituent atoms.

CASTEP offers simulation capabilities not found elsewhere, such as
accurate prediction of phonon spectra, dielectric constants, and optical
properties.

CASTEP is suited to research problems in solid state physics,
materials science, chemistry, and chemical engineering.

## Usage

CASTEP is a part of the Materials Studio package. To prepare CASTEP jobs,
you need to install it locally. Necessary Information can be found on our
[CSC Materials Studio page].

Computationally demanding jobs are best run on a separate server. Here
are instructions to run [Standalone jobs at CSC] on Puhti.
