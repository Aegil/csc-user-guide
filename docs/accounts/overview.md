# Overview

The customer portal [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi) is the gateway to CSCâ€™s
services such as supercomputers, software, cloud services and data
storage. The old portal [SUI](https://sui.csc.fi) will be shut down by
the end of the year.

## MyCSC

Through MyCSC you can e.g.

* register as a CSC customer, 
* manage your personal information,
* create projects, 
* add members to projects,
* add services of your choice to your projects,
* apply for billing units (BU) for your projects and
* monitor the BU consumption of you projects.

For more information, see the following sections.

## SUI

Not all features of SUI are yet available via MyCSC. For example, the
access to [IDA Research Data
Storage](https://www.fairdata.fi/en/ida/becoming-an-ida-user/) is
still applied via SUI until this feature is implemented to MyCSC.
