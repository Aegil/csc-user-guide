# Getting account without Haka or Virtu

The preferred method of registration for CSC is to use the Haka or
Virtu login. If it is not available, the alternative method is to send
the details listed below to us by email.

This concerns mostly foreign collaborators of Finland-based research
groups, but basically anybody who has a project to join can register
this way.

The application should include the following information:

* Project identifier (e.g. 2001679, uef4713)
* Collaborator's name, organization and e-mail address
* Period of time for which the right for use is applied

The applications are always approved if [eligibility
criteria](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases) are met.

Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi.

!!! Note

    If you cannot use Haka or Virtu, and do not have a project to
    join, you may get an account if your home organization has a
    contract with CSC or you have been granted resources through some
    programme. Contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi and provide details
    about your use case, and we will check your eligibility.
