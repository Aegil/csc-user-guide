## Puhti FMI partition specific instructions
The Puhti FMI partition is available only for users from FMI. The FMI users, however, can also use the general Puhti system and CSC's other services.
### Projects: Puhti-FMI vs. Puhti and CSC:s other services
A project can only use either the FMI partition or the general partition and CSC's other services, not both. Hence, if an FMI project PI wants use both the general partition/CSC's other services and the FMI partition, he or she must create separate projects.

A project for the general partition and CSC's other services is created as described in https://docs.csc.fi/#accounts/creating-new-project/. For project type please choose Academic and add Puhti and/or other services as needed as described in https://docs.csc.fi/#accounts/adding-service-access-for-project/.

A project for the FMI partition is created similarly, but for the service Puhti-FMI is chosen. 

For the time being, an additional step is required: The PI must send an email with the project identifying number to servicedesk@csc.fi and ask that Puhti-FMI is assigned with the project. Jobs can be submitted to the FMI partition only after servicedesk has confirmed the access.
