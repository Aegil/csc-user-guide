# How to add service access for project

This document shows how you can add service access for your project.
Available are the following services: computing services Puhti and
Taito; cloud services ePouta, cPouta and Rahti; storage services Allas
and IDA; and database service Kaivos.

Service access has two-step approval: (1) The project manager approves
the service for the project and (2) members approve it for themselves.
