# Creating new user account

There are three different types of user account that you can get for
CSC: ordinary accounts for general use (which you can get with or
without Haka or Virtu), student accounts for cources and robot
accounts for managing own services. Below are instructions on how you
can get them.

## Getting account with Haka or Virtu

If your home organization is a member of Haka or Virtu federation, you
can create a user account for you as self-service.

1. Go to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Click on Virtu or Haka depending on which federation your home
organization belongs.
1. Select your home organization and login to their identity service.
1. Fill in your information on the Sign up page.
1. Set your password using 12 characters or more, contain both upper
and lowercase letters and at least 1 number. No special characters are
allowed.
1. You will receive your CSC user account information to your email.

## Getting account without Haka or Virtu

The preferred method of registration for CSC is to use the Haka or
Virtu login. If it is not available, the alternative method is to send
the details listed below to us by email.

This concerns mostly foreign collaborators of Finland-based research
groups, but basically anybody who has a project to join can register
this way.

The application should include the following information:

* Project identifier (e.g. 2001679, uef4713)
* Collaborator's name, organization and email address
* Period of time for which the right for use is applied

The applications are always approved if [eligibility
criteria](https://research.csc.fi/free-of-charge-use-cases) are met.

Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi.

!!! Note

    If you cannot use Haka or Virtu, and do not have a project to
    join, you may get an account if your home organization has a
    contract with CSC or you have been granted resources through some
    programme. Contact us at servicedesk@csc.fi and provide details
    about your use case, and we will check your eligibility.

## Getting student accounts for course

If you are a teacher and you wish to get course accounts for your
students, please send us the following details by email. You must be a
registered CSC user before we can make you the course accounts.

* Start and end date of the course
* Username of the teacher (responsible of these accounts)
* Teacher's mobile number (where passwords are sent via SMS)
* The number of accounts needed

We will create the accounts for you and the account details are sent
to you by email and SMS. Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi.

!!! Note

    The student accounts are valid over the duration of the
    course. Please order the accounts early, at least one week before
    the course starts.

## Getting machine-to-machine robot account

If you are a registered CSC user and need another account to manage
services that you run in CSC services, we can create a
machine-to-machine robot account for you. Please send us the following
details by email.

* Project identifier (e.g. 2001679, uef4713) of the project that your
  service uses
* CSC service which your service uses (e.g. cPouta, Rahti)
* Your mobile number (where the password is sent via SMS)

Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi.
