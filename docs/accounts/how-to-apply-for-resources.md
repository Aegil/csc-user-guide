Resource applications are submitted as follows:

1. Login to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Click the project that need more resources.
1. Under _Resource Applications_, click _Apply for Resources_.
1. Fill in the application and click _Apply_.
1. A link to your submitted application shows up under Resource
applications, where you can view its details and status. You and your
project manager will also receive email notifications about the
submission.
1. When the application has been processed, you will receive another
email that tells how much resources you have been granted.

!!! Notes

    Academic projects are asked to fill in the science area,
    publications, etc. If those are irrelevant for your work, your
    project type should probably be Commercial.

    All members of the project can submit resource applications.

Resource applications cannot be edited after their submission, but you
may ask us to reject them. You can then submit another
application. Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi.
