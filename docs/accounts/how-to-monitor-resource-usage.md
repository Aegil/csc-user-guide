# How to monitor resource usage

CSC resources are measured in Billing Units (BU). Their consumption
can be followed up as follows:

1. Login to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. Choose _My Projects_ in the navigation menu on the left.
1. Choose the project which usage you want to watch.
1. The usage is shown under _Resource Usage_.

In the usage plot, you can:

* View monthly usage by user by hovering the mouse over the bars.
* Select or unselect certain users by clicking their username.
* Switch between cumulative and regular view.

!!! Note

    Do not confuse quotas with resources. Quotas are service-specific
    limits to keep the usage within limits. See instructions under
    Computing, Cloud and Data, to find out how the remaining quotas
    can be followed up in each service.
