## Billing
For Puhti a new billing scheme is introduced. Taito billing is not changed.
### Puhti compute billing
Puhti is a heterogenous system with CPU, GPU and IO nodes and nodes with varying amount of memory. Moreover, it is possible to use only a fraction of a node and its various resources. The billing scheme tries to charge the billing units (BUs) in fair way based on the reserved amount of node resources.

#### Allas object storage billing
