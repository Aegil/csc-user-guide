## Billing
For Puhti a new billing scheme is introduced. Taito billing is not changed.
### Puhti compute billing
Puhti is a heterogenous system with CPU, GPU and IO nodes and nodes with varying amount of memory. Moreover, it is possible to use only a fraction of a node and its various resources. The billing scheme tries to charge the billing units (BUs) in fair way based on the reserved amount of node resources.

In the billing scheme the BU consumption rate of a compute job depends linearly on the number of requested cores and GPUs and the amount of requested memory (per core). More precisely,

### Storage billing
#### Lustre/work disk billing
#### Allas object storage billing
