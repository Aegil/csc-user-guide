# Getting accounts for international collaborators

The preferred method of registration for CSC is to use the Haka
login. If it is not available, the alternative method is to send the
details listed below to us by email.

This concerns mostly foreign collaborators of Finland-based research
groups.

The application should include the following information:

* Project manager's name, position, organization, and e-mail address
* Project title
* Researcher's name, position, organization, e-mail address, and
  nationality (who is working abroad)
* The status of the foreign research institution (university,
  government research institute, other - which?)
* Researcher's funding organization
* Short description of the project's goals and methods
* The role of the project manager in the project
* The role of the researcher working abroad in the project (i.e., the
  added value the researcher brings to the project)
* CSC's services required (computing servers, software, database
  services, data and archiving services)
* Estimate on needed computing resources (billing units)
* Period of time for which the right for use is applied

The applications are always approved if [eligibility
criteria](https://research.csc.fi/accounts-for-researchers-working-abroad)
are met.
