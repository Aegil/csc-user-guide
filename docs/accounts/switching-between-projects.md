# Switching between projects

On the Dashboard of MyCSC, there is a chart showing how much resources
you have left in one of your projects. You can change that project as
follows.

1. Go to [MyCSC](https://my.csc.fi).
1. On the left navigation menu, choose My profile.
1. Select the Default billing project.
1. Click on Save.

The selected default billing project is migrated to several services:

* On Puhti, the billing project dictates the default group ownership
  of new files that you create. (There is one Linux group for each
  project.)
* On Taito, the usage is by default charged to the billing
  project. The billing project also dictates the default group
  ownership of new files that you create. (There is one Linux group
  for each project.)
* On Rahti, the usage is by default charged to the billing project.

See service-specific instructions under Computing, Cloud and Data, to
find out more details about project selection in each service.
