1. Go to [MyCSC](http://my.csc.fi).
1. On the left navigation menu, choose My Projects.
1. Click on the project that you want to use with the service.
1. Under Services, choose the service.
1. Read the terms of service, tick that you have read and accept them.
Click on Apply for Access.
1. You will receive an email to the address associated with your CSC
user account when the service access has been granted.

All members of the project need to read and accept the terms of
service that they wish to use. When the service access is granted for
the project manager, other members get an email that their service
access is waiting for their approval. What they need to do next is to
find the service that is waiting their approval and accept its terms
of service. The wrench symbol indicates which services are waiting an
approval.

!!! Note

    Project manager is the only person who can add or remove services
    of the project.
