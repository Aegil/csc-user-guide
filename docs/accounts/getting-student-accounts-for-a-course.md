# Getting student accounts for a course

If you are a teacher and you need to order accounts for your students,
here is what you need to do.

The student accounts are always valid for a certain course and we are
asking you to order the accounts early, at least one week before the
course starts. Please send us following details by email:

* Start and end date of the course
* Name of the teacher (teacher is responsible of these accounts)
* Her/his mobile number (password for these accounts is sent via SMS)
* How many accounts do you need

Also the teacher needs to have her/his own CSC account. We will
create the accounts for you and details are sent by email and SMS.
Our email address is servicedesk@csc.fi
